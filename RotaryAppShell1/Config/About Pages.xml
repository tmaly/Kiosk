Klumph, the father of The Rotary Foundation, was born in 1869 in Conneautville, Pennsylvania and later moved to Cleveland, Ohio. When he was a teenager, a friend’s father overheard Klumph planning a budget for a variety show and offered him a job at the Cuyahoga Lumber Company, where Klumph would later become president and, eventually, sole owner. Klumph steadily rose to prominence leading industrial companies and serving on the boards of professional and cultural organizations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Klumph became a charter member of the Rotary Club of Cleveland in 1911 and club president in 1913. The next year, he was elected a director of the International Association of Rotary Clubs (as Rotary was then called) and served as its president in 1916-17. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the 1917 Rotary convention, Klumph defined several areas he considered essential for Rotary’s future growth and success – including an endowment: “…it seems eminently proper that we should accept endowments for the purpose of doing good in the world, in charitable, educational or other avenues of community progress…” Through Klumph&#39;s simple yet profound statement, the Rotary Endowment Fund, which would later become The Rotary Foundation, was born. The first contribution was made by the Rotary Club of Kansas City in 1917.

Klumph Society members play a vital role in helping The Rotary Foundation carry out its mission: to enable Rotarians to advance world understanding, goodwill, and peace through the improvement of health, the support of education, and the alleviation of poverty. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;In 1917, RI President Arch C. Klumph proposed the creation of an endowment for “doing good in the world.”
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Since then, Foundation projects have met a wide range of human needs, from clean drinking water and medical equipment to literacy training and microenterprise loans. The Foundation’s Rotary Peace Centers prepare Rotary Peace Fellows for leadership roles in resolving conflicts all over the world.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;PolioPlus, launched in 1985, is helping to immunize all children against polio. Eradicating this crippling and sometimes fatal disease remains Rotary International’s top priority.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Having taken Klumph’s words as its motto in 2006, the Foundation reviewed its programs for sustainability. In 2013, it implemented a new grant model that enables Rotary members to fund sustainable projects in six areas of focus: promoting peace, fighting disease, providing clean water, saving mothers and children, supporting education, and growing local economies.&lt;/div&gt;' ows_Image_1_PathRI='About Pages/AboutRotary/01_Brown.jpg' ows_Image_2_PathRI='About Pages/AboutRotary/02_3H_India.jpg' ows_Image_3_PathRI='About Pages/AboutRotary/03_Romania.JPG' ows_Image_4_PathRI='About Pages/AboutRotary/04_Honduras.jpg' ows_Image_5_PathRI='About Pages/AboutRotary/05_Tajikstan.jpg' ows_Image_6_PathRI='About Pages/AboutRotary/06_Brazil_Bakery.jpg' ows_Image_7_PathRI='About Pages/AboutRotary/07_Mongolia.jpg' ows_Image_8_PathRI='About Pages/AboutRotary/08_Niger.JPG' ows_Image_9_PathRI='About Pages/AboutRotary/09_Bridge_Peru.jpg' ows_Image_10_PathRI='About Pages/AboutRotary/10_Erin_Raab.JPG' ows_Image_11_PathRI='About Pages/AboutRotary/11_Gani_Abazi.jpg' ows_Image_12_PathRI='About Pages/AboutRotary/12_Spurway.jpg' ows_Image_13_PathRI='About Pages/AboutRotary/13_Logioco.jpg' ows_Image_14_PathRI='About Pages/AboutRotary/14_Zambia_GSE.jpg' ows_Image_15_PathRI='About Pages/AboutRotary/14_Zambia_GSE1.jpg' ows_Image_16_PathRI='About Pages/AboutRotary/15_Dutch_GSE.jpg' />

Rotary has helped immunize more than 2.5 billion children against polio. It has also contributed more than $1.2 billion and helped secure over $9 billion from donor governments for efforts to eradicate the disease.

PolioPlus grants support National Immunization Days and other eradication efforts in polio-endemic and high-risk countries.

The End Polio Now – Make History Today funding campaign is an extension of Rotary’s partnership with the Gates Foundation. From 2013 to 2018, every $1 that Rotary commits to the World Health Organization and UNICEF in direct support for polio immunization will be matched 2-to-1, up to $35 million per year, by the Gates Foundation.
